This project was created using reactstrap and creat-react-app

## Library Used
* Just for learning purpose the hooks implementation of redux has been used in this project
* reactstrap which contains bootstrap4 components are used for generating responsive elements

Note: Site is still not fully responsive

## Project Structure
* Animal Component contains the list of the cards and the controller can be used to insert a new animal or search a specific animal
* Animal and Controller is bootstrapped in layout which was usually not necessary in here but is useful when you have multiple pages. I am used to this structure so i have used it but you may remove it if you want and move navbar code to app.

## Future Improvements

* Update
* Pagination
* Images of animals
* Backend
* Fix Search
* More suggestions are appreciated
